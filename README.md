### 🚧 THIS PROJECT IS NOT PRODUCTION READY, [USE THIS ONE INSTEAD](https://github.com/onbjerg/ethers-flashbots) 🚧

Rust client for interacting directly with the Flashbots Relays.

## How does it work ?

Using a client from the [reqwest](https://crates.io/crates/reqwest) crate, you can use a set of methods to interact with the following Flashbots relays endpoints:

- [X] `eth_sendBundle`
- [X] `eth_callBundle`
- [X] `eth_sendPrivateTransaction`
- [X] `eth_cancelPrivateTransaction`
- [X] `flashbots_getUserStats`
- [X] `flashbots_getBundleStats`

It uses [ethers-rs](https://github.com/gakonst/ethers-rs) to perform ECDSA signatures and the main inspiration when it comes to code architecture comes from the [opensea-rs](https://github.com/gakonst/opensea-rs) project.

So, thanks [Georgios K.](https://github.com/gakonst) for the indirect help !

Huge thanks to [Chris H.](https://github.com/metachris/) for his work on [the golang version of the client](https://github.com/metachris/flashbotsrpc).
I developed this project based on his version.
